# thermalloadsensitivity
The Thermal Load Sensitivity (TLS) framework builds on the Thermal Death Time (TDT) model, which integrates the magnitude and duration of stress, to now explore how accumulation of damage and subsequent recovery influences whole-organism responses to thermal stress across taxonomic groups
